# PCA_ICA_DEMO
Demo for PCA(Principal Component Analysis) &amp; ICA(Independent Component Analysis) in data analysis in Python and image separation written in MATLAB 

>>This is a simple demo for PCA and ICA in Python 3.6.
The powerpoint we made just for lesson , not for business or money at all.

_*PCA:*_
I perfer to run it in Jupyter notebook.If you like, you can change the path for input dataset by rewrite <br>
'''
df=pd.read_excel('E:\pycharm-items-github\grade3.xls')
'''
<br>
in line 12.

_*ICA:*_
* Step 1 show a PICs for the orignal lines, 4 lines for different data;
* Srep 2 A PICs named mixed_lines for mixing 4 lines for different data;
* Step 3 show the separated lines in a PIC called After_lines.jpy.
